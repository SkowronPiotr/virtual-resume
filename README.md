## Summary

This is a page that aims to summarize my most important projects, there is a lot of additional information about every project in portfolio section. I had a lot of fun with this project because it is simple and shows how much progress I have made in my ongoing journey. Both in terms of documented work and the quality of this project

This is my first project in which I work with a signal and context processor
